# NPDESRiverChemistryAnalysis
Analysis of NPDES river chemistry samples collected for whole effluent toxicity tests.
## 
Chronic toxicity monitoring is required for some industrial and municipal facilties under National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. As part of the toxicity testing process, ambient surface waters upstream of the discharges are collected and used as dilution water. This project provides a script to summarize the chemistry data for each NPDES site, providing summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean) of chemical parameters.
